# AGENTS

Guidance for coding agents (and humans) working in this repository.

## Build and test

Tasks live in the `justfile`; run `just` to list them. There is no Makefile —
`make` cannot forward arguments, which forced developers onto stale prebuilt
binaries. Everything below runs from source.

- `just check` must pass. It is `gofmt` + `go vet ./...` + `go test -race ./...`,
  in the same order as `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- `just build` must succeed.
- `just prompt "…"` / `just ask PROVIDER MODEL "…"` drive the CLI from source.
- `just e2e` drives the built binary against a mock provider.

See [docs/development.md](docs/development.md) for the full local and QA workflow.

## Security invariants — do not weaken

- **Untrusted content stays untrusted.** Read/WebSearch/WebFetch output is
  sanitized (delimiter markup removed) and then run through a tool-less
  classifier before it can be promoted. It never enters system/agent blocks.
- **Delimiters are sealed.** Every harness delimiter carries a random nonce
  plus a SHA-256 integrity hash of its enclosed content. On egress, any block
  lacking a nonce, carrying an unknown nonce, or failing its integrity hash is
  stripped before HTTP transport.
- **Classifier turns are tool-less.** The classifier payload carries no tools,
  no skills, and no agent block.
- **Tool-call mismatch defaults to abort.** Stripping or ignoring mismatches
  requires explicit user opt-in.
- **Skills and hooks validate first.** Skills load only after strict
  front-matter schema validation; hooks load only after schema validation with
  no arbitrary code-path injection.

## Layout

- `cmd/signet` — entrypoint.
- `internal/...` — library code, one package per concern.
- `e2e/` — end-to-end tests that drive the built binary.
- `docs/` — architecture, specs, and the development workflow.

## Conventions

- Fail closed by default; relaxation is an explicit user opt-in.
- Every new package gets a package doc comment and unit tests.
- Keep package boundaries narrow; reuse `internal/config` for paths and state.
